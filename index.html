    <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of    granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.<br><br>
    First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

    <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/firerestrictions.htm">current fire restrictions.</a></p>
